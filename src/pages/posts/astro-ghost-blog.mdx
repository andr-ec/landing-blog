import { Image } from "@astrojs/image/components";

I currently run a company blog on Ghost, and I wanted to try out Astro on my personal blog.
The twist is that I wanted to use Ghost as a Headless CMS only for my posts, and override the default ghost theme with Astro.

It's actually what's used to power this blog.
Some posts are brought in from ghost some are written in Astro (MDX).

# Ghost Previews

The first step Is showing previews of ghost content and then linking to the original content

Ghost has an sdk https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/javascript/ we can install using:

```bash
npm install @tryghost/content-api
```

Then we can use the sdk to get the posts

```js
---

// index.astro
import GhostContentAPI from '@tryghost/content-api'
const ghost = new GhostContentAPI({
  url: 'https://blog.mysite.com',
  key: 'my-ghost-content-key',
  version: "v5.0"
});



const ghostPosts = await ghost.posts
    .browse({limit: 5, include: 'tags,authors', filter: 'author:andre'})

---
		<ul>

			{
				ghostPosts.map((post) => (
					<li>
						<time {datetime} class="min-w-[120px] text-gray-500">{postDate}</time>
							<Element>
								<a href={post.url} class="inline-block cactus-link line-clamp-1">
									{post.title}
								</a>
							</Element>
							{
								withDesc && (
									<q class="block italic line-clamp-3">{post.excerpt}</q>
								)
							}
					</li>
				))
			}
        </ul>
```

That's really it if you want to show previews of your ghost content.
it will link to the the original content on your ghost blog.

# Embedding Ghost Content

Now to embed the ghost content we'll need to pull in another dependency

```bash
npm install -D astro-remote
```

`remote-astro` is a plugin that allows you to render remote html or markdown.
One thing to look out for is that it's just a proof of concept and is not production ready.
But it works well enough for my personal blog at the moment.
The biggest bug is that some content is not rendered correctly. 🤷🏽‍♂️

All that's needed is a dynamic route and components to render the content.

The Dynamic route:

```js
---
// [slug].astro
import BlogPost from "@/layouts/BlogPost";
import ghost from "@/ghost";
import { ghostToSimplePost } from "@/util";
// https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-scvgee?file=src%2Fpages%2Findex.astro
import { Markup } from "astro-remote";
import { components, sanitize } from "src/components/base/components";

export async function getStaticPaths() {
	const ghostPosts = await ghost.posts
		.browse({ limit: 5, include: "tags,authors", filter: "author:andre" })
		.then((p) => {
			return p.map(ghostToSimplePost);
		});

	const paths = ghostPosts.map((post) => {
		return {
			params: { slug: post.slug },
			props: { post },
		};
	});
	return paths;
}
const { slug } = Astro.params;
const postContent = await ghost.posts.read(
	{ slug },
	{ formats: ["html", "plaintext"] }
);
const { post } = Astro.props;
const blogContent = { ...post, description: undefined };
---

<BlogPost content={blogContent} headings={post.headings}>
	<Markup content={postContent.html} {sanitize} {components} />
</BlogPost>
```

The Components:

```js
import Paragraph from "./Paragraph.astro";
import Title from "./Title.astro";
import Span from "./Span.astro";
import A from "./A.astro";
import Div from "./Div.astro";
import Img from "./Img.astro";

export const sanitize = {
	dropElements: ["head"],
	blockElements: ["html", "body"],
};

export const components = {
	h1: Title,
	p: Paragraph,
	span: Span,
	a: A,
	div: Div,
	img: Img,
};
```

Notice that I import each component so that I can override the default behavior of the components.
For example: I want to style with tailwind classes based on the input class from ghost.

```js
---
// Div.astro
const props = Astro.props;
const classMap = {
	"kg-bookmark-content": "grow",
	"kg-bookmark-thumbnail": "flex-initial basis-1/4 h-40",
	"kg-bookmark-description": "hidden",
	"kg-bookmark-metadata": "h-20 w-full flex",
};

const newClass = Object.hasOwn(classMap, props.class)
	? classMap[props.class]
	: props.class;
---

<div class={newClass}><slot /></div>
```

That's about it.

The blog will need to be rebuilt every time you make a change to the ghost content, which can be automated.
